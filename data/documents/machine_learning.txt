Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Training with labeled data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Training with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks

Common Libraries:
- scikit-learn: General-purpose ML algorithms
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Deep learning with dynamic computation graphs
- Keras: High-level neural networks API

Model Training Process:
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model selection
4. Training and validation
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Evaluation and deployment
